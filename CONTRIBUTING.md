This project will be submitted for "Quality award 2020" https://www.yegor256.com/award.html
If this project wins, it will receive $4096 award or less.
So I'm proposing 4096 equity shares for this project with cost 1 share = $1
You may join this project as developer and receive shares for closing tickets,
if this project wins "Quality award" share cost may be recalculated, it's possible to
win $4096, $2048 or $1024, depends on price amount 1 share may cost:
 $1    - for $4096 price
 $0.5  - for $2048 price
 $0.25 - for $1024 price
After receiving the price, you (contributor) will be able to exchange your shares
to cash, e.g. if you earn 200 shares and project win $2048 you will get $100 of cash.

To receive shares you need to join this project via Zerocracy https://www.0crat.com/p/CJT4R32Q3
and complete assigned tasks, thats all, you'll get your shares automatically.
